Large Scale Image Classification Based on a Multi-Class Logistic Regression Model
=======================

## Introduction
This is a project, which provides efficient and accurate multi-class classification based on logistic regression for large-scale data. The compputation cost was reduced considerably by random sampling in training examples for each iteration. The approach was tested on a large data pool with 1,000,000 examples, which have 900 features and span a wide variety of 164 classes. It achieved a mean average precision up to 50% with training time limited to only 6 hours on a regular PC.
